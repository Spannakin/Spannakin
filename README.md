- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Spannakin

- Iâ€™m an outdoor enthusiast and nature lover, my day job is fundraising for the RSPB and can most often be found outside covered in mud! Coding is something of a side hustle for me, I'm not one to choose the easy route. I love the challenge of learning new skills and helping people to create websites that work for them. I have a varied background in both the private and charity sectors and am happy to share my skills and knowledge with others.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Graduate from Code Institute with a  Full Stack Developer diploma. I love the front end and developing great user experiences and am looking forward to getting better at creating clean stylish code.
