- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Spannakin
- Iâ€™m an outdoor enthusiast and nature lover, I'm totally new to coding and am looking to move into the sector, I'm interested in meeting new people and learning new skills. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning with the Code Institute on the Full Stack Developer diploma. I'm currently learning front end languages and UX, which I'm really
enjoying. But I'm also looking forward to learing about Back end and how that all fits together.
